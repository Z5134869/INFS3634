# CovidTracker ðŸ¦ 

CovidTracker is a comprehensive Coronavirus app that provides data on COVID19 new and total cases per country updated daily.

It is based on the [COVID 19 API](https://covid19api.com/), a free API for data on the Coronavirus that can be used to build dashboards, mobile apps or be integrated in to other applications. The data is sourced from Johns Hopkins CSSE. The app simply shows a list of countries and provides a set of detailed information about their COVID19 case numbers.

This project is part of a university course on mobile application development using the Android platform.
